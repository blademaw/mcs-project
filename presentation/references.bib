	abstract = {Ice jams pose a major flood hazard in communities along northern rivers, resulting in high backwater levels and overbank flooding during ice-cover breakup. Mitigation measures, including large-scale projects by government agencies and individual actions by asset owners, can help reduce flood risk and protect human life and assets. This study examines ice-jam flood risk and explores the effectiveness of adaptive strategies in mitigating such risks in Fort McMurry, Canada. It evaluates the effectiveness of top-down (government-led artificial breakup) and bottom-up (resident-led flood-proofing) strategies, comparing the Rational Choice Theory (RCT) and the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) models. The objective is to explore the potential enhancements to the ice-jam flood risk model through the integration of the PMT as a decision-making framework under uncertainty. This study seeks to assess whether and to what extent such integration can improve the modeling of ice-jam flood risk. The findings highlight the benefits of incorporating socio-economic factors in the PMT model. Economic factors, such as income tax and the cost of flood-proofing, shape overall flood risk, especially when artificial breakup measures are not implemented. The study emphasizes the importance of considering heterogeneity in decisionmaking processes and diverse characteristics of individuals when designing flood risk management strategies. Response efficacy and self-efficacy coefficients are significant factors influencing flood risk and the adoption of flood-proofing measures. Enhancing individuals’ belief in their actions’ effectiveness and their confidence in selfprotection contributes to more effective flood risk management. These findings inform the development of more effective flood risk management strategies.},

	abstract = {Two decades ago a research team clarified that cross-sectional associations of risk perceptions and protective behavior can only test an “accuracy” hypothesis: e.g., people with higher risk perceptions at Ti should also exhibit low protective behavior and/or high risky behavior at Ti. They argued that these associations are too often interpreted wrongly as testing two other hypotheses, only testable longitudinally: the “behavioral motivation” hypothesis, that high risk perception at Ti increases protective behavior at Ti+1, and the “risk reappraisal” hypothesis, that protective behavior at Ti reduces risk perception at Ti+1. Further, this team argued that risk perception measures should be conditional (e.g., personal risk perception if one’s behavior does not change). Yet these theses have garnered relatively little empirical testing. An online longitudinal panel study of U.S. residents’ COVID-19 views across six survey waves over 14 months in 2020–2021 tested these hypotheses for six behaviors (hand washing, mask wearing, avoiding travel to infected areas, avoiding large public gatherings, vaccination, and [for five waves] social isolation at home). Accuracy and behavioral motivation hypotheses were supported for both behaviors and intentions, excluding a few waves (particularly in February–April 2020, when the pandemic was new in the U.S.) and behaviors. The risk reappraisal hypothesis was contradicted—protective behavior at one wave increased risk perception later—perhaps reflecting continuing uncertainty about efficacy of COVID-19 protective behaviors and/or that dynamic infectious diseases may yield different patterns than chronic diseases dominating such hypothesis-testing. These findings raise intriguing questions for both perceptionbehavior theory and behavior change practice.},

Yet, the key ecological and evolutionary dimensions of vector-borne disease that facilitate their emergence have not been thoroughly explored. This study reviews and synthesizes the existing literature to explore global patterns of emerging vector-borne zoonotic diseases (VBZDs) under changing global conditions. We ﬁnd that the vast majority of emerging VBZDs are transmitted by ticks (Ixodidae) and mosquitoes (Culicidae) and the pathogens transmitted are dominated by Rickettsiaceae bacteria and RNA viruses (Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Togaviridae). The most common potential driver of these emerging zoonoses is land use change, but for many diseases, the driver is unknown, revealing a critical research gap. While most reported VBZDs are emerging in the northern latitudes, after correcting for sampling bias, Africa is clearly a region with the greatest share of emerging VBZD. We highlight critical gaps in our understanding of VBZD emergence and emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary research and consideration of deeper evolutionary processes to improve our capacity for anticipating where and how such diseases have and will continue to emerge.},

	abstract = {To robustly predict the effects of disturbance and ecosystem changes on species, it is necessary to produce structurally realistic models with high predictive power and ﬂexibility. To ensure that these models reﬂect the natural conditions necessary for reliable prediction, models must be informed and tested using relevant empirical observations. Patternoriented modelling (POM) offers a systematic framework for employing empirical patterns throughout the modelling process and has been coupled with complex systems modelling, such as in agent-based models (ABMs). However, while the production of ABMs has been rising rapidly, the explicit use of POM has not increased. Challenges with identifying patterns and an absence of speciﬁc guidelines on how to implement empirical observations may limit the accessibility of POM and lead to the production of models which lack a systematic consideration of reality. This review serves to provide guidance on how to identify and apply patterns following a POM approach in ABMs (POM-ABMs), speciﬁcally addressing: where in the ecological hierarchy can we ﬁnd patterns; what kinds of patterns are useful; how should simulations and observations be compared; and when in the modelling cycle are patterns used? The guidance and examples provided herein are intended to encourage the application of POM and inspire efﬁcient identiﬁcation and implementation of patterns for both new and experienced modellers alike. Additionally, by generalising patterns found especially useful for POM-ABM development, these guidelines provide practical help for the identiﬁcation of data gaps and guide the collection of observations useful for the development and veriﬁcation of predictive models. Improving the accessibility and explicitness of POM could facilitate the production of robust and structurally realistic models in the ecological community, contributing to the advancement of predictive ecology at large.},

We use the example of the TELL ME agent-based model to consider ways in which a non-predictive policy model can assist policy makers. This model concerns individuals’ protective behaviors in response to an epidemic, and the communication that influences such behavior. Drawing on findings from stakeholder workshops and the results of the model itself, we suggest such a model can be useful: (i) as a teaching tool, (ii) to test theory, and (iii) to inform data collection.

            Water reuse can serve as a sustainable alternative water source for urban areas. However, the successful implementation of large‐scale water reuse projects depends on community acceptance. Because of the negative perceptions that are traditionally associated with reclaimed water, water reuse is often not considered in the development of urban water management plans. This study develops a simulation model for understanding community opinion dynamics surrounding the issue of water reuse, and how individual perceptions evolve within that context, which can help in the planning and decision‐making process. Based on the social amplification of risk framework, our agent‐based model simulates consumer perceptions, discussion patterns, and their adoption or rejection of water reuse. The model is based on the “risk publics” model, an empirical approach that uses the concept of belief clusters to explain the adoption of new technology. Each household is represented as an agent, and parameters that define their behavior and attributes are defined from survey data. Community‐level parameters—including social groups, relationships, and communication variables, also from survey data—are encoded to simulate the social processes that influence community opinion. The model demonstrates its capabilities to simulate opinion dynamics and consumer adoption of water reuse. In addition, based on empirical data, the model is applied to investigate water reuse behavior in different regions of the United States. Importantly, our results reveal that public opinion dynamics emerge differently based on membership in opinion clusters, frequency of discussion, and the structure of social networks.},

	abstract = {In metropolitan areas people travel frequently and extensively but often in highly structured commuting patterns. We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it.},

              Mobility restrictions are successfully used to contain the diffusion of epidemics. In this work we explore their effect on the epidemic growth by investigating an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model in which individual mobility is taken into account. In the model individual agents move on a chessboard with a Lévy walk and, within each square, epidemic spreading follows the standard SIR model. These simple rules allow to reproduce the sub-exponential growth of the epidemic evolution observed during the Covid-19 epidemic waves in several countries and which cannot be captured by the standard SIR model. We show that we can tune the slowing-down of the epidemic spreading by changing the dynamics of the agents from Lévy to Brownian and we investigate how the interplay among different containment strategies mitigate the epidemic spreading. Finally we demonstrate that we can reproduce the epidemic evolution of the first and second COVID-19 waves in Italy using only 3 parameters, i.e , the infection rate, the removing rate, and the mobility in the country. We provide an estimate of the peak reduction due to imposed mobility restrictions, i. e., the so-called
              flattening the curve
              effect. Although based on few ingredients, the model captures the kinetic of the epidemic waves, returning mobility values that are consistent with a lock-down intervention during the first wave and milder limitations, associated to a weaker peak reduction, during the second wave.},

	abstract = {Background: Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re)emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines.
Methods: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening.
Results: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous betweenand within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable.
Conclusions: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent “branding”. Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.},

Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model speciﬁcation, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. R software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations.

Mathematical models describing dengue fever epidemiological dynamics are found back from 1970. Dengue fever is a viral mosquito-borne infection caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4). With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection, it is a major international public health concern. Although most of the cases are asymptomatic or mild, the disease immunological response is complex, with severe disease linked to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) - a disease augmentation phenomenon where pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection. Here, we present a 10-year systematic review on mathematical models for dengue fever epidemiology. Speciﬁcally, we review multi-strain frameworks describing host-to-host and vector-host transmission models and within-host models describing viral replication and the respective immune response.},

We observe an increasing trend in published BCMs, frequently coupled to (re)emergence events, and propose a categorization by distinguishing how information translates into preventive actions. Behaviour is usually captured by introducing information as a dynamic parameter (76/178) or by introducing an economic objective function, either with (26/178) or without (37/178) imitation. Approaches using information thresholds (29/178) and exogenous behaviour formation (16/178) are also popular. We further classify according to disease, prevention measure, transmission model (with 81/178 population, 6/178 metapopulation and 91/178 individual-level models) and the way prevention impacts transmission. We highlight the minority (15\%) of studies that use any real-life data for parametrization or validation and note that BCMs increasingly use social media data and generally incorporate multiple sources of information (16/178), multiple types of information (17/178) or both (9/178). We conclude that individual-level models are increasingly used and useful to model behaviour changes. Despite recent advancements, we remain concerned that most models are purely theoretical and lack representative data and a validation process.},

	abstract = {The Ross-Macdonald model has dominated theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics and control for over a century. The model, like many other basic population models, makes the mathematically convenient assumption that populations are well mixed; i.e., that each mosquito is equally likely to bite any vertebrate host. This assumption raises questions about the validity and utility of current theory because it is in conflict with preponderant empirical evidence that transmission is heterogeneous. Here, we propose a new dynamic framework that is realistic enough to describe biological causes of heterogeneous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens of humans, yet tractable enough to provide a basis for developing and improving general theory. The framework is based on the ecological context of mosquito blood meals and the fine-scale movements of individual mosquitoes and human hosts that give rise to heterogeneous transmission. Using this framework, we describe pathogen dispersion in terms of individual-level analogues of two classical quantities: vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number, R0. Importantly, this framework explicitly accounts for three key components of overall heterogeneity in transmission: heterogeneous exposure, poor mixing, and finite host numbers. Using these tools, we propose two ways of characterizing the spatial scales of transmission—pathogen dispersion kernels and the evenness of mixing across scales of aggregation—and demonstrate the consequences of a model’s choice of spatial scale for epidemic dynamics and for estimation of R0, both by a priori model formulas and by inference of the force of infection from timeseries data.},

	abstract = {Background: Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on successful behaviour change interventions. This requires an appropriate method for characterising interventions and linking them to an analysis of the targeted behaviour. There exists a plethora of frameworks of behaviour change interventions, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose. This paper evaluates these frameworks, and develops and evaluates a new framework aimed at overcoming their limitations.
Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases and consultation with behaviour change experts were used to identify frameworks of behaviour change interventions. These were evaluated according to three criteria: comprehensiveness, coherence, and a clear link to an overarching model of behaviour. A new framework was developed to meet these criteria. The reliability with which it could be applied was examined in two domains of behaviour change: tobacco control and obesity.
Results: Nineteen frameworks were identified covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that could enable those interventions. None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention functions or policies, and only a minority met the criteria of coherence or linkage to a model of behaviour. At the centre of a proposed new framework is a ‘behaviour system’ involving three essential conditions: capability, opportunity, and motivation (what we term the ‘COM-B system’). This forms the hub of a ‘behaviour change wheel’ (BCW) around which are positioned the nine intervention functions aimed at addressing deficits in one or more of these conditions; around this are placed seven categories of policy that could enable those interventions to occur. The BCW was used reliably to characterise interventions within the English Department of Health’s 2010 tobacco control strategy and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence’s guidance on reducing obesity.
Conclusions: Interventions and policies to change behaviour can be usefully characterised by means of a BCW comprising: a ‘behaviour system’ at the hub, encircled by intervention functions and then by policy categories. Research is needed to establish how far the BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.},

This article presents a critical review of 29 HBM-related investigations published during the period 1974-1984, tabulates the findings from 17 studies conducted prior to 1974, and provides a summary of the total 46 HBM studies (18 prospective, 28 retrospective). Twenty-four studies examined preventive-health be haviors (PHB), 19 explored sick-role behaviors (SRB), and three addressed clinic utilization. A "significance ratio" was constructed which divides the number of positive, statistically- significant findings for an HBM dimension by the total number of studies reporting significance levels for that dimension. Summary results provide substantial empirical support for the HBM, with findings from prospective studies at least as favorable as those obtained from retrospective research. "Perceived barriers" proved to be the most powerful of the HBM dimensions across the various study designs and behaviors. While both were important overall, "perceived sus ceptibility" was a stronger contributor to understanding PHB than SRB, while the reverse was true for "perceived benefits." "Perceived severity" produced the lowest overall significance ratios; however, while only weakly associated with PHB, this dimension was strongly related to SRB. On the basis of the evidence compiled, it is recommended that consideration of HBM dimensions be a part of health education programming. Suggestions are offered for further research.},

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of health education based on the protection motivation theory on malaria preventive behaviors in the households of Ghale Ganj, Kerman, Iran in 2011.
Methods: The present quasi‑experimental study was conducted on 144 households covered by 8 health centers of Ghale Ganj, Kerman. The study samples were selected through systematic random sampling and the study data were collected using a questionnaire including demographic information, the constructs of the protection motivation theory, and a checklist for assessing the malaria preventive behaviors. After the pre‑test, the intervention group underwent an educational intervention and after two months, the post‑test was performed through the same questionnaire. Then, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (v. 18) and analyzed using Chi‑square and Wilcoxon non‑parametric tests. Besides, P {\textless} 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results: Before the intervention, no significant difference was found between the two study groups regarding perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, response costs, self‑efficacy, response efficacy, and malaria preventive behaviors. After the intervention, however, a significant increase was observed in the intervention group’s mean scores of all the constructs of the protection motivation theory as well as malaria preventive behaviors ( P {\textless} 0.01).
Conclusions: According to the findings of the study, educational intervention based on the protection motivation theory is highly effective in promoting malaria preventive behaviors.},

            Prevention behaviors are important in mitigating the transmission of COVID‐19. The protection motivation theory (PMT) links perceptions of risk and coping ability with the act of adopting prevention behaviors. The goal of this research is to test the application of the PMT in predicting adoption of prevention behaviors during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Two research objectives are achieved to explore motivating factors for adopting prevention behaviors. (1) The first objective is to identify variables that are strong predictors of prevention behavior adoption. A data‐driven approach is used to train Bayesian belief network (BBN) models using results of a survey of  participants reporting risk perceptions and prevention behaviors during the COVID‐19 pandemic. A large set of models are generated and analyzed to identify significant variables. (2) The second objective is to develop models based on the PMT to predict prevention behaviors. BBN models that predict prevention behaviors were developed using two approaches. In the first approach, a data‐driven methodology trains models using survey data alone. In the second approach, expert knowledge is used to develop the structure of the BBN using PMT constructs. Results demonstrate that trust and experience with COVID‐19 were important predictors for prevention measure adoption. Models that were developed using the PMT confirm relationships between coping appraisal, threat appraisal, and protective behaviors. Data‐driven and PMT‐based models perform similarly well, confirming the use of PMT in this context. Predicting adoption of social distancing behaviors provides insight for developing policies during pandemics.},

The purpose of this study was to identify within the framework of the Health Belief Model, relevant demographic and psychosocial predictors of TBD personal protective behaviors (PPB) among Fish and Wildlife, and State Parks employees in the U.S. State of Florida. Following informed consent, an e-survey was used to obtain cross-sectional data from 631 study participants. Seven scales and one index of items were adopted to operationalize the independent variables in this study. Study ﬁndings revealed that only twenty-ﬁve percent of respondents reported receiving occupational risk training about TBD from their employer. ‘Checking for ticks on skin’ was the TBD PPB most adopted by study participants, while the least adopted TBD PPB was ‘tucking pants into socks’. We found the most signiﬁcant predictors of checking for ticks on skin to be ‘high speciﬁc knowledge of TBD PPB’, ‘high perceived risk for TBD’, ‘high intention of taking action to prevent tick bites’, and ‘high perceived self-eﬃcacy for taking action to prevent tick bites’. This study represents a response to the collective call for TBD research focused on the unique issues in Florida. Study ﬁndings suggest that occupational training of employees should tailor interventions toward males. Such eﬀorts should focus on increasing speciﬁc knowledge of TBD PPB.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, tiger mosquitoes have rapidly colonized a large number of European countries, increasing the risk of infection with mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs), and constituting an emerging health threat in the region. The objectives of the present study were to prospectively investigate changes in Self-protective Behaviors, beliefs and attitudes regarding MBDs in Mediterranean France, and to assess the inﬂuence of social and cognitive time-varying covariates on behaviors. Data were collected using the same computer-assisted telephone survey in 2012, 2013 and 2014 among respondents residing in French Mediterranean regions. Weighted estimates in multivariate analysis were computed using the generalized estimating equation technique, with Self-protective Behaviors as a repeated outcome. Perceived exposure to tiger mosquitoes and knowledge about MBDs increased signiﬁcantly between 2012 and 2014. Most respondents suffered from mosquito bites over the same period, but only 4 in 10 adopted Self-protective Behaviors. These behaviors were mostly related to the frequency of mosquito bites, perceived exposure to tiger mosquitoes, and to higher perceived vulnerability to MBDs. In conclusion, French Mediterranean residents are increasingly knowledgeable about MBDs and the proximity of tiger mosquitoes. However, self-protection was predominantly related to the frequency of mosquito bites and higher perceived vulnerability. These results suggest that Self-protective Behaviors are being shaped more in new risk areas by environmental cues to which people are exposed than by other common personal determinants of health behaviors.},

	abstract = {Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus. In humans, 80\% of infections are asymptomatic, while approximately 20\% experience influenza-like symptoms. Fewer than 1\% develop the neuroinvasive form which can lead to encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and even death. The global spread of the virus to areas where it was not previously present has become a growing concern. Since the 2000 s, there have been numerous outbreaks affecting local and travelling populations worldwide. Given the lack of a vaccine, preventative measures are primarily focused on surveillance, vector control, and the use of personal protective behaviours (PPBs). The importance of PPBs is central to public health recommendations. However, translating these messages into coherent action by the public can prove challenging, as the uptake of such measures is inevitably influenced by socio-economic factors, awareness, knowledge, and risk perception.
Methods: A PRISMA-based systematic research was conducted on EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. PROSPERO registration number CRD42023459714. Quality of studies included in the final stage was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cross-Sectional Study (CEBMa).
Results: 2963 articles were screened, and 17 studies were included in the final round. Out of these, six were deemed of high quality, ten were of medium quality, and one was of low quality. In almost all studies considered, both awareness and knowledge of WNV transmission were above 90\%, while concern about WNV ranged from 50\% to 80\%. Concern about the safety of repellents, either with or without DEET, ranged from 27\% to 70\%. The percentage of people actually using repellents ranged from 30\% to 75\%, with the lowest usage reported among individuals over 60 years old (29\%) and pregnant women (33\%), and the highest among students aged 9–11 (75\%). Concern for West Nile Virus (WNV) was consistently linked to an increase in taking preventative measures, including the use of repellents, by two to four times across studies. The school-based intervention was effective in increasing the practice of removing standing water (AOR=4.6; 2.7–8.0) and wearing long clothing (AOR=2.4; 95\%CI: 1.3–4.3), but did not have a significant impact on the use of repellents.
Conclusions: The present systematic review provides an overview of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of WNV and their determinants. While concern about West Nile Virus (WNV) and its effects can be a significant motivator, it is important to promote evidence-based personal protective behaviours (PPBs) to counter unwarranted fears. For example, the use of repellents among the most vulnerable age groups. Given the geographical expansion of WNV, it is necessary to target the entire population preventively, including those who are difficult to reach and areas not yet endemic. The findings of this investigation could have significant implications for public health and support well-informed and effective communication strategies and interventions.},

Researchers who use survey data to investigate these questions often look at the wrong correlations to get their answers. Furthermore, as members of a population adopt precautions and change their risk status, correlations between perceived risk and risk behavior in this population also change. A mathematical model of precaution adoption—allowing a bidirectional relationship between perception and behavior—is used to illustrate the different correlations between risk perception and risk behavior that can be examined and the changes in correlations that can occur with the passage of time. Recommendations are provided concerning the correlations most appropriate for answering each of the 2 preceding questions. Which correlation is appropriate to answer the second question varies depending on whether a study is begun before people have taken precautions or after ample time to take precautions has already passed.},

	abstract = {Background: The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is responsible for the transmission of many arboviruses worldwide and is well adapted to thrive in urban environments. In mainland France, a nonendemic area, this mos‑quito is responsible for several autochthonous and imported cases of chikungunya and dengue each year. Better management and prevention of mosquito‑borne disease transmission in nonendemic areas is thus of global concern. In this context, the aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of mosquito–human interactions as well as human behavior and beliefs in regard to this mosquito species in urban areas.
Methods: We focused on people who participate in community gardens, which are increasingly popular initiatives in metropolitan France and are conducive to the development of tiger mosquitoes. To evaluate community gardeners’ knowledge and practices in relation to mosquito management and control, we conducted a knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) survey.
Results: In contrast to previous KAP studies, we showed that attitudes, more than knowledge, influence the practices of community gardeners in relation to mosquitoes. Interestingly, all gardeners who participated in the survey were concerned about the Asian tiger mosquito and were motivated to incorporate mosquito control methods in their gar‑dens. Moreover, mosquitoes were perceived as nuisances rather than disease vector species. A change in community gardeners’ perceptions could facilitate more appropriate behavior to control this species.
Conclusions: This survey reveals the lack of knowledge and awareness of good practices for the efficient control of the Asian tiger mosquito in green urban areas.},

Purpose: To discuss and carry out appropriate tests of 3 easily confused hypotheses: (a) the behavior motivation hypothesis (perceptions of personal risk cause people to take protective action), (b) the risk reappraisal hypothesis (when people take actions thought to be effective, they lower their risk perceptions), and (c) the accuracy hypothesis (risk perceptions accurately reflect risk behavior). Methods: Longitudinal study with an initial interview just after the Lyme disease vaccine was made publicly available and a follow-up interview 18 months later. Random sample of adult homeowners (N = 745) in 3 northeastern U.S. counties with high Lyme disease incidence. Lyme disease vaccination behavior and risk perception were assessed. Results: All 3 hypotheses were supported. Participants with higher initial risk perceptions were much more likely than those with lower risk perceptions to get vaccinated against Lyme disease (OR = 5.81, 95\% CI 2.63–12.82, p {\textless} .001). Being vaccinated led to a reduction in risk perceptions, χ2(1, N = 745) = 30.90, p {\textless} .001, and people vaccinated correctly believed that their risk of future infection was lower than that of people not vaccinated (OR = .44, 95\% CI .21–.91, p {\textless} .05). Conclusions: The behavior motivation hypothesis was supported in this longitudinal study, but the opposite conclusion (i.e., that higher risk led to less protective behavior) would have been drawn from an incorrect test based only on cross-sectional data. Health researchers should take care in formulating and testing risk-perception-behavior hypotheses.},

Community participation has the potential for effective and efficient control of the disease, but this is subject to how communities are engaged in specific activities. Historical, political, social and economic factors have undermined the social institutions and conventions in the study villages that could facilitate community involvement. In particular, poverty and differences in local interests influence the capacity for people to be involved. Villagers regarded the maintenance of the domestic environment as a personal responsibility and were reluctant to extend their action to a wider domain. Comprehensive programmes, which draw on local institutions and understandings of community and enable community members to participate in the planning and management of prevention and control activities, are essential to ensure programme sustainability and effectiveness.},

Initiatives such as the integrated management strategy for dengue prevention and control (IMS-Dengue) and integrated vector management (IVM) incorporate social mobilisation and behavioural change at the community level as part of a wider strategy to control dengue. These strategies aim to improve the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact and sustainability of vector control strategies. Community empowerment is a key aspect of the strategy as it allows the local population to drive eradication of the disease in their environment. Through the patio limpio campaign, the concept of community participation has been employed in Mexico to raise awareness of the consequences of dengue. Patio limpio consists of training local people to identify, eliminate, monitor and evaluate vector breeding sites systematically in households under their supervision. A community participation programme in Guerrero State found that approximately 54\% were clean and free of breeding sites. Households that were not visited and assessed had a 2.4-times higher risk of developing dengue than those that were. However, after a year, only 30\% of trained households had a clean backyard. This emphasises the need for a sustainable process to encourage individuals to maintain efforts in keeping their environment free of dengue.},

	abstract = {Effort to control dengue transmission requires community participation to ensure its sustainability. We carried out a knowledge attitude and practice (KAP) survey of dengue prevention to inform the design of a vector control intervention. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June–August 2014 among 521 households in two villages of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Demographic characteristics and KAP questions were asked using a self-managed questionnaire. Knowledge, attitudes and practice scores were summarized for the population according to sex, age, occupation and education. The average knowledge score was rather poor—3.7 out of 8—although both attitude and practice scores were good: 25.5 out of 32 and 9.2 out of 11 respectively. The best knowledge within the different groups were found among women, the age group 30–44 years, people with a university degree and government employees. Best practice scores were found among retired people and housewives. There were several signiﬁcant gaps in knowledge with respect to basic dengue symptoms, preventive practices and biting and breeding habits of the Aedes mosquito. In contrast, people’s practices were considered good, although many respondents failed to recognize outdoor containers as mosquito breeding sites. Accordingly, we developed a vector control card to support people’s container cleaning practices. The card was assessed for eight consecutive weeks in 2015, with pre-post larvae positive houses and containers as primary outcome measures. The use of control cards reached a low engagement of the community. Despite ongoing campaigns aiming to engage the community in dengue prevention, knowledge levels were meagre and adherence to taught routines poor in many societal groups. To increase motivation levels, bottom-up strategies are needed to involve all community members in dengue control, not only those that already comply with best practices.},

	abstract = {The world's climate appears now to be changing at an unprecedented rate. Shifts in the distribution and behaviour of insect and bird species indicate that biological systems are already responding to this change. It is well established that climate is an important determinant of the spatial and temporal distribution of vectors and pathogens. In theory, a change in climate would be expected to cause changes in the geographical range, seasonality (intra–annual variability), and in the incidence rate (with or without changes in geographical or seasonal patterns). The detection and then attribution of such changes to climate change is an emerging task for scientists. We discuss the evidence required to attribute changes in disease and vectors to the early effects of anthropogenic climate change. The literature to date indicates that there is a lack of strong evidence of the impact of climate change on vector–borne diseases (i.e. malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis, tick–borne diseases). New approaches to monitoring, such as frequent and long–term sampling along transects to monitor the full latitudinal and altitudinal range of specific vector species, are necessary in order to provide convincing direct evidence of climate change effects. There is a need to reassess the appropriate levels of evidence, including dealing with the uncertainties attached to detecting the health impacts of global change.},

	abstract = {Background: Malaria is an increasing concern in Indonesia. Socio-demographic factors were found to strongly influence malaria prevalence. This research aimed to explore the associations between socio-demographic factors and malaria prevalence in Indonesia.
Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design and analysed relationships among the explanatory variables of malaria prevalence in five endemic provinces using multivariable logistic regression.
Results: The analysis of baseline socio-demographic data revealed the following independent risk variables related to malaria prevalence: gender, age, occupation, knowledge of the availability of healthcare services, measures taken to protect from mosquito bites, and housing condition of study participants. Multivariable analysis showed that participants who were unaware of the availability of health facilities were 4.2 times more likely to have malaria than those who were aware of the health facilities (adjusted odds ratio = 4.18; 95\% CI 1.52–11.45; P = 0.005).
Conclusions: Factors that can be managed and would favour malaria elimination include a range of prevention behaviours at the individual level and using the networks at the community level of primary healthcare centres. This study suggests that improving the availability of a variety of health facilities in endemic areas, information about their services, and access to these is essential.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne diseases continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world. All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge, and outline related initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. Much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to climate change, and the use of scenario-based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases. While these can give useful indications, the unavoidable uncertainty in such analyses, and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future, limit their utility as decision-support tools. For operational health agencies, the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down current disease rates and manage short-term climate risks, which will, in turn, increase resilience to long-term climate change. The WHO and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to (i) ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens; (ii) promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management; (iii) support applied research, through definition of global and regional research agendas, and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups.},

	abstract = {Background: Vector-borne diseases cause a significant proportion of the overall burden of disease across the globe, accounting for over 10 \% of the burden of infectious diseases. Despite the availability of effective interventions for many of these diseases, a lack of resources prevents their effective control. Many existing vector control interventions are known to be effective against multiple diseases, so combining vector control programmes to simultaneously tackle several diseases could offer more cost-effective and therefore sustainable disease reductions. Discussion: The highly successful cross-disease integration of vaccine and mass drug administration programmes in low-resource settings acts a precedent for cross-disease vector control. Whilst deliberate implementation of vector control programmes across multiple diseases has yet to be trialled on a large scale, a number of examples of ‘accidental’ cross-disease vector control suggest the potential of such an approach. Combining contemporary high-resolution global maps of the major vector-borne pathogens enables us to quantify overlap in their distributions and to estimate the populations jointly at risk of multiple diseases. Such an analysis shows that over 80 \% of the global population live in regions of the world at risk from one vector-borne disease, and more than half the world’s population live in areas where at least two different vector-borne diseases pose a threat to health. Combining information on co-endemicity with an assessment of the overlap of vector control methods effective against these diseases allows us to highlight opportunities for such integration. Summary: Malaria, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, and dengue are prime candidates for combined vector control. All four of these diseases overlap considerably in their distributions and there is a growing body of evidence for the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets, screens, and curtains for controlling all of their vectors. The real-world effectiveness of cross-disease vector control programmes can only be evaluated by large-scale trials, but there is clear evidence of the potential of such an approach to enable greater overall health benefit using the limited funds available.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne disease (MBD) control depends largely on a range of public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of infected mosquitoes and human-mosquito contact. These public health measures are generally driven by voluntary, though in few occasions obligatory (e.g., indoor residual spraying), self-protective behaviors by individuals and communities. To develop effective interventions that promote public health measures, the underlying mechanisms that contribute to self-protective behaviors should be well understood. The present scoping review aims to provide a timely overview of how behavior change theories have been applied in the context of MBD control. In addition, the review proposes an integrated model that includes identified key determinants in MBD control behavior, and identifies knowledge gaps to inform future research. A comprehensive search was performed in several databases: MEDLINE, Psy­ cINFO, Embase (Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, ERIC, and Econ.Lit (EBSCO), as well as registered trials and reviews in CENTRAL and PROSPERO to identify ongoing or un­ published studies. References of included studies and literature reviews were screened, as well as citation tracking in Web of Science, Google Scholar and the malaria database of Behavior Change Impact. This scoping review identified a total of 28 studies. Most studies targeted personalprotective behavioral measures such as adopting, using, or maintaining insecticide-treated bed nets, and were most frequently informed by risk-related behavioral theories. Knowledge and perceived susceptibility of the risk, and related perceived efficacy were identified as key behavioral determinants in the conceptual, integrated human behavior model for MBD control. Numerous studies related to MBD control behavior, especially those focusing on knowledgeattitudes-practices (KAP), often lack a solid theoretical framework, which risks depicting an incomplete understanding of behaviors. In addition, by incorporating various behavioral disci­ plines into the domain of MBD control, a more comprehensive understanding of key behavioral determinants may be developed and applied in future research and MBD control efforts.},

A previous cluster randomized control trial engaged nine intervention communities in seven participatory activities to promote man‑agement of the domestic and peri-domestic environment to reduce risk factors for vector-borne Chagas disease. This study aims to assess the adoption of this innovative community-based strategy, which included chickens’ manage‑ment, indoor cleaning practices, and domestic rodent infestation control, using concepts from the Diffusion of Inno‑vations Theory. We used questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to understand perceptions of knowledge gained, intervention adoption level, innovation attributes, and limiting or facilitating factors for adoption. The analysis process focused on five innovation attributes proposed by the Diffusion of Innovations Theory: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Rodent management was highly adopted by participants, as it had a relative advantage regarding the use of poison and was compatible with local practices. The higher complex‑ity was reduced by offering several types of trapping systems and having practical workshops allowed trialability. Observability was limited because the traps were indoors, but information and traps were shared with neighbors. Chicken management was not as widely adopted due to the higher complexity of the method, and lower compat‑ibility with local practices. Using the concepts proposed by the Diffusion of Innovations Theory helped us to identify the enablers and constraints in the implementation of the Chagas vector control strategy. Based on this experience, community engagement and intersectoral collaboration improve the acceptance and adoption of novel and inte‑grated strategies to improve the prevention and control of neglected diseases.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as malaria, dengue, and leishmaniasis exert a huge burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly affecting the poorest of the poor. The principal method by which these diseases are controlled is through vector control, which has a long and distinguished history. Vector control, to a greater extent than drugs or vaccines, has been responsible for shrinking the map of many VBDs. Here, we describe the history of vector control programmes worldwide from the late 1800s to date. Pre 1940, vector control relied on a thorough understanding of vector ecology and epidemiology, and implementation of environmental management tailored to the ecology and behaviour of local vector species. This complex understanding was replaced by a simplified dependency on a handful of insecticide-based tools, particularly for malaria control, without an adequate understanding of entomology and epidemiology and without proper monitoring and evaluation. With the rising threat from insecticide-resistant vectors, global environmental change, and the need to incorporate more vector control interventions to eliminate these diseases, we advocate for continued investment in evidence-based vector control. There is a need to return to vector control approaches based on a thorough knowledge of the determinants of pathogen transmission, which utilise a range of insecticide and non–insecticide-based approaches in a locally tailored manner for more effective and sustainable vector control.},

Here, we use simulations to investigate how correlations between the viral load of cases in transmission chains can affect estimates of these fundamental transmission properties. Our computational model simulates a disease transmission mechanism in which the viral load of the infector at the time of transmission influences the infectiousness of the infectee. These correlations in transmission pairs produce a population-level convergence process during which the distributions of initial viral loads in each subsequent generation converge to a steady state. We find that outbreaks arising from index cases with low initial viral loads give rise to early estimates of transmission properties that could be misleading. These findings demonstrate the potential for transmission mechanisms to affect estimates of the transmission properties of newly emerged viruses in ways that could be operationally significant to a public health response.},

Among other advantages, the proposed modeling framework enables proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the “appeal” of a political movement) and the social dynamics which are its realization; this characterization is key to successful social process prediction. The utility of the modeling methodology is illustrated through a case study involving the global SARS epidemic of 2002-2003.

	abstract = {Innovation diffusion has been studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, economics, marketing, ecology, and computer science. Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables ﬁne-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the ﬁelds of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion. Although many advances have been made to standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration and validation, and suggest potential solutions.},

	abstract = {Background: Predicting the spatial distribution of pathogens with an environmental stage is challenging because of the difficulty to detect them in environmental samples. Among these pathogens, the parasite Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of the zoonosis toxoplasmosis, which is responsible for public health issues. Oocysts of T. gondii are excreted by infected cats in the environment, where they may survive and remain infectious for intermediate hosts, specifically rodents, during months to years. The landscape structure that determines the density and distribution of cats may thus impact the spatial distribution of T. gondii. In this study, we investigated the influences of rural settings on the spatial distribution of oocysts in the soil.
Method: We developed a spatially explicit agent based model to study how landscape structures impact on the spatial distribution of T. gondii prevalence in its rodent intermediate host as well as contamination in the environment. The rural landscape was characterized by the location of farm buildings, which provide shelters and resources for the cats. Specifically, we considered two configurations of farm buildings, i.e. inside and outside a village. Simulations of the first setting, with farm buildings inside the village, were validated using data from previous field studies. Then, simulation results of the two settings were compared to investigate the influences of the farm locations.
Results: Model predictions showed a steeper relationship between distance to the nearest farm and infection levels when farm buildings, and thus cats, were concentrated in the same area than when the farms were spread over the area. The relationship between distance to the village center and level of environmental contamination also differed between settings with a potential increased risk for inhabitants when farms are located inside the village. Maps of the risk of soil contaminated with oocysts were also derived from the model.
Conclusion: The agent-based model provides a useful tool to assess the risk of contamination by T. gondii oocysts at a local scale and determine the most at risk areas. Moreover it provides a basis to investigate the spatial dynamics of pathogens with an environmental stage.},

                  The cane toad (
                  Bufo marinus
                  ) is an invasive species in Australia that has a negative impact on native species. Control methods such as trapping, fencing, and water exclusion have been devised to contain the spread of cane toads and reduce their ecological impact. However, implementing these interventions is expensive, and estimating the likely impact of a proposed intervention on spread at a large spatial scale, comprising one or more control methods, is challenging due to the lack of large-scale data and the computational cost of modelling a large number of toads.
                
              
              
                To address this challenge, we developed a multiscale model which uses individual-level data on cane toad behaviour to estimate the impact of trapping, fencing, and water exclusion when applied at scale in the Pilbara region in north-western Australia. Compared to previous work, our model allows us to explore more complex combinations and tradeoffs of control methods by utilising data sources at different scales.
              
              
                Our results suggest that exclusion of toads from water points is the most effective method for containing the spread of cane toads, and that trapping and fencing alone are unlikely to be sufficient. However, trapping and fencing are still useful supplementary measures in scenarios where exclusion cannot be broadly applied to a large number of water points.
              
              
                
                  Synthesis and applications
                  . Our analyses highlight the importance of limiting access to sheltering and breeding sites in invasive species control. Furthermore, this study illustrates the value of multiscale computational models for exploring scenarios where parameters and calibration data are available at the scale of individuals and small groups, but management questions are framed at a much larger scale.},

	abstract = {Background: The threat of a rapidly changing planet – of coupled social, environmental and climatic change –pose new conceptual and practical challenges in responding to vector-borne diseases. These include non-linear and uncertain spatial-temporal change dynamics associated with climate, animals, land, water, food, settlement, conflict, ecology and human socio-cultural, economic and political-institutional systems. To date, research efforts have been dominated by disease modeling, which has provided limited practical advice to policymakers and practitioners in developing policies and programmes on the ground. Main body: In this paper, we provide an alternative biosocial perspective grounded in social science insights, drawing upon concepts of vulnerability, resilience, participation and community-based adaptation. Our analysis was informed by a realist review (provided in the Additional file 2) focused on seven major climate-sensitive vectorborne diseases: malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue, leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, chagas disease, and rift valley fever. Here, we situate our analysis of existing community-based interventions within the context of global change processes and the wider social science literature. We identify and discuss best practices and conceptual principles that should guide future community-based efforts to mitigate human vulnerability to vector-borne diseases. We argue that more focused attention and investments are needed in meaningful public participation, appropriate technologies, the strengthening of health systems, sustainable development, wider institutional changes and attention to the social determinants of health, including the drivers of co-infection. Conclusion: In order to respond effectively to uncertain future scenarios for vector-borne disease in a changing world, more attention needs to be given to building resilient and equitable systems in the present.},

	abstract = {Background:  As climate variability and extreme weather events associated with climate change become more prevalent, public health authorities can expect to face an expanding spectrum of vector-borne diseases with increasing incidence and geographical spread. Common interventions include the use of larvicides and adulticides, as well as targeted communications to increase public awareness regarding the need for personal protective measures, such as mosquito repellant, protective clothing, and mosquito nets. Here, we propose a simplified compartmental model of mosquito-borne disease dynamics that incorporates the use of personal protection against mosquito bites influenced by two key individual-level behavioral drivers—concern for being bitten by mosquitos as a nuisance and concern for mosquito-borne disease transmission.
Methods:  We propose a modified compartmental model that describes the dynamics of vector-borne disease spread in a naïve population while considering the public demand for community-level control and, importantly, the effects of personal-level protection on population-level outbreak dynamics. We consider scenarios at low, medium, and high levels of community-level vector control, and at each level, we consider combinations of low, medium, and high levels of motivation to use personal protection, namely concern for disease transmission and concern for being bitten in general.
Results:  When there is very little community-level vector control, nearly the entire population is quickly infected, regardless of personal protection use. When vector control is at an intermediate level, both concerns that motivate the use of personal protection play an important role in reducing disease burden. When authorities have the capacity for high-level community vector control through pesticide use, the motivation to use personal protection to reduce disease transmission has little additional effect on the outbreak.
Conclusions:  While results show that personal-level protection alone is not enough to significantly impact an outbreak, personal protective measures can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak in conjunction with community-level control. Furthermore, the model provides insight for targeting public health messaging to increase the use of personal protection based on concerns related to being bitten by mosquitos or vector-borne disease transmission.},

If risk perception is a good indicator of the actual risk, then it has important implications in a context of disease elimination. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the role of human behavior in disease transmission. The objective of this study is to explore whether preventive behavior is responsive to risk perception, taking into account the links with disease knowledge and controlling for individuals’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.

            Preventing vector-borne diseases (VBDs) mainly relies on effective vector control tools and strategies, which in turn depend on population acceptance and adherence. Inspired by the abundant recent literature on SARS-COV-2, we investigate the relationship between risk perception and preventive behaviour for selected VBDs and the extent to which risk perception is determined by social norms. We use cross-sectional data collected from 497 individuals in four regions of Guyana in 2017. We use a conditional mixed process estimator with multilevel coefficients, estimated through a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework, applying a simultaneous equation structure. We find robust results on malaria: risk perception was significantly influenced by the risk perception of the reference group across different definitions of the reference group, hinting at the existence of social norms. Risk perception significantly increased the likelihood of passive behaviour by 4.48\%. Less clear-cut results were found for dengue. This study applies quantitative social science methods to public health issues in the context of VBDs. Our findings point to the relevance of tailoring communications on health risks for VBDs to groups defined at the intersection of socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Such tailored strategies are expected to align risk perception among reference groups and boost preventive behaviour.},

While both social and ecological factors influence the chance encounter between snakes and people, the spatio-temporal processes underlying snakebites remain poorly explored. Previous research has focused on statistical correlates between snakebites and ecological, sociological, or environmental factors, but the human and snake behavioral patterns that drive the spatio-temporal process have not yet been integrated into a single model. Here we use a bottom-up simulation approach using agent-based modelling (ABM) parameterized with datasets from Sri Lanka, a snakebite hotspot, to characterise the mechanisms of snakebite and identify risk factors. Spatio-temporal dynamics of snakebite risks are examined through the model incorporating six snake species and three farmer types (rice, tea, and rubber). We find that snakebites are mainly climatically driven, but the risks also depend on farmer types due to working schedules as well as species present in landscapes. Snake species are differentiated by both distribution and by habitat preference, and farmers are differentiated by working patterns that are climatically driven, and the combination of these factors leads to unique encounter rates for different landcover types as well as locations. Validation using epidemiological studies demonstrated that our model can explain observed patterns, including temporal patterns of snakebite incidence, and relative contribution of bites by each snake species. Our predictions can be used to generate hypotheses and inform future studies and decision makers. Additionally, our model is transferable to other locations with high snakebite burden as well.},

              Several decades have elapsed since the introduction in 1988 of the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) by researchers from Clark University and Decision Research. SARF was offered as an umbrella under which social, psychological, and cultural theories of risk could be integrated and thereby supplement technical risk analyses. Some critics suggest that SARF cannot be tested thus, the framework is useful, at most, as a
              post hoc
              analysis of some kinds of risks. Others counter that predictability is not required for a framework to be useful and that SARF is an effective tool in organizing data related to public perceptions, values, and behaviors. It can also be used to design more effective risk communication and public engagement strategies. SARF also suggests how to conceptually view the dynamics of social media channels, despite the fact that SARF was developed before the explosion of global digital platforms. The papers in this special issue consider developments, refinements, critiques, contributions, extensions of the approach to new risk issues, as well as the findings and hypotheses that have grown out of what is now close to three decades of empirical research. This introductory paper provides background on SARF, presents a literature review since 2003, introduces the contributions to this issue, and highlights several areas for future research.},

            The article distinguishes between two types of risks: conventional and systemic risks. Conventional risks can be contained in space and time, follow linear cause–effect relationships and can be addressed with effective and pointed interventions into the cause–effect chain. Systemic risks, however, are characterized by high complexity, transboundary effects, stochastic relationships, nonlinear cause–effect patterns with tipping points, and are often associated with less public attention than they require. The article addresses the reasons why systemic risks seem to be attenuated in public perception. The article goes on to consider how the social amplification of risk framework is useful in the context of systemic risks and describes needed extensions of that framework. It identifies practical tools for assessing the significance of perceptions for systemic risk situations. Finally, it argues that a graphic representation and simulation of evolving systemic risks and potential countermeasures as well as a participatory deliberative approach of inclusive risk governance are suitable governance strategies for preventing, mitigating, or managing systemic risks.},

As a result, individual self-interest might preclude complete eradication of a vaccine-preventable disease. We show that a formal game theoretical analysis of this problem leads to new insights that help to explain human decision-making with respect to vaccination. Increases in perceived vaccine risk will tend to induce larger declines in vaccine uptake for pathogens that cause more secondary infections (such as measles and pertussis). After a vaccine scare, even if perceived vaccine risk is greatly reduced, it will be relatively difficult to restore prescare vaccine coverage levels.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling is increasingly being used in computational epidemiology to characterize important behavioral dimensions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual responses to interventions, when studying the spread of a disease. Existing agent-based simulation frameworks and platforms currently fall in one of two categories: those that can simulate millions of individuals with simple behaviors (e.g., based on simple state machines), and those that consider more complex and social behaviors (e.g., agents that act according to their own agenda and preferences, and deliberate about norm compliance) but, due to the computational complexity of reasoning involved, have limited scalability. In this paper, we present a novel framework that enables large-scale distributed epidemic simulations with complex behaving social agents whose decisions are based on a variety of concepts and internal attitudes such as sense, knowledge, preferences, norms, and plans. The proposed framework supports simulations with millions of such agents that can individually deliberate about their own knowledge, goals, and preferences, and can adapt their behavior based on other agents’ behaviors and on their attitude toward complying with norms. We showcase the applicability and scalability of the proposed framework by developing a model of the spread of COVID-19 in the US state of Virginia. Results illustrate that the framework can be effectively employed to simulate disease spreading with millions of complex behaving agents and investigate behavioral interventions over a period of time of months.},

Humans constantly update their opinion by integrating new information they hear with their values, which helps them make a judgement about that new information. Here, we create an agent-based model that explicitly incorporates the concept of values to explore possible drivers of opinion dynamics. In the model, we explore several factors and perform local and global sensitivity analysis to test their individual and interaction effects. We find that consensus formation in the model is mainly determined by factors related to (1) the amount of stochasticity in the opinion updating procedure and (2) the relative ease with which old links are removed and new links are created. Our results demonstrate how opinions and values may co-evolve. Furthermore, they may help in understanding human responses to new policies such as covid-related restrictions or calls to shift to a more plant-based diet.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission originated in the early twentieth century to provide insights into how to most effectively combat malaria. The foundations of the Ross–Macdonald theory were established by 1970. Since then, there has been a growing interest in reducing the public health burden of mosquito-borne pathogens and an expanding use of models to guide their control. To assess how theory has changed to confront evolving public health challenges, we compiled a bibliography of 325 publications from 1970 through 2010 that included at least one mathematical model of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and then used a 79-part questionnaire to classify each of 388 associated models according to its biological assumptions. As a composite measure to interpret the multidimensional results of our survey, we assigned a numerical value to each model that measured its similarity to 15 core assumptions of the Ross–Macdonald model. Although the analysis illustrated a growing acknowledgement of geographical, ecological and epidemiological complexities in modelling transmission, most models during the past 40 years closely resemble the Ross–Macdonald model. Modern theory would benefit from an expansion around the concepts of heterogeneous mosquito biting, poorly mixed mosquito-host encounters, spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation in the transmission process.},

	abstract = {Background  Protecting public health from infectious diseases often relies on the cooperation of citizens, especially when self-care interventions are the only viable tools for disease mitigation. Accordingly, social aspects related to public opinion have been studied in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of opinion-related factors on disease spread still requires further exploration.
Methods  We propose an agent-based simulation framework incorporating opinion dynamics within an epidemic model based on the assumption that mass media channels play a leading role in opinion dynamics. The model simulates how opinions about preventive interventions change over time and how these changes affect the cumulative number of cases. We calibrated our simulation model using YouGov survey data and WHO COVID-19 new cases data from 15 different countries. Based on the calibrated models, we examine how different opinion-related factors change the consequences of the epidemic. We track the number of total new infections for analysis.
Results  Our results reveal that the initial level of public opinion on preventive interventions has the greatest impact on the cumulative number of cases. Its normalized permutation importance varies between 69.67\% and 96.65\% in 15 models. The patterns shown in the partial dependence plots indicate that other factors, such as the usage of the prointervention channel and the response time of media channels, can also bring about substantial changes in disease dynamics, but only within specific ranges of the dominant factor.
Conclusions  Our results reveal the importance of public opinion on intervention during the early stage of the pandemic in protecting public health. The findings suggest that persuading the public to take actions they may be hesitant about in the early stages of epidemics is very costly because taking early action is critical for mitigating infectious diseases. Other opinion-related factors can also lead to significant changes in epidemics, depending on the average level of public opinion in the initial stage. These findings underscore the importance of media channels and authorities in delivering accurate information and persuading community members to cooperate with public health policies.},

There is a similar need for the spread of mosquito borne pathogens due to the re-emergence of diseases such as chikungunya and dengue fever. A network-patch model for mosquito dynamics has been coupled with EpiSimS. Mosquitoes are represented as a “patch” or “cloud” associated with a location. Each patch has an ordinary differential equation (ODE) mosquito dynamics model and mosquito related parameters relevant to the location characteristics. Activities at each location can have different levels of potential exposure to mosquitoes based on whether they are inside, outside, or somewhere in-between. As a proof of concept, the hybrid network-patch model is used to simulate the spread of chikungunya through Washington, DC. Results are shown for a base case, followed by varying the probability of transmission, mosquito count, and activity exposure. We use visualization to understand the pattern of disease spread.},

            Agent-based modelling is a useful approach for capturing heterogeneity in disease transmission. In this study, a synthetic population was developed for American Samoa using an iterative approach based on population census, questionnaire survey and land use data. The population will be used as the basis for a new agent-based model, intended specifically to fill the knowledge gaps about lymphatic filariasis transmission and elimination, but also to be readily adaptable to model other infectious diseases. The synthetic population was characterized by the statistically realistic population and household structure, and high-resolution geographic locations of households. The population was simulated over 40 years from 2010 to 2050. The simulated population was compared to estimates and projections of the U.S. Census Bureau. The results showed the total population would continuously decrease due to the observed large number of emigrants. Population ageing was observed, which was consistent with the latest two population censuses and the Bureau’s projections. The sex ratios by age groups were analysed and indicated an increase in the proportion of males in age groups 0–14 and 15–64. The household size followed a Gaussian distribution with an average size of around 5.0 throughout the simulation, slightly less than the initial average size 5.6.},

            Despite the global impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the question of whether mandated interventions have similar economic and public health effects as spontaneous behavioural change remains unresolved. Addressing this question, and understanding differential effects across socioeconomic groups, requires building quantitative and fine-grained mechanistic models. Here we introduce a data-driven, granular, agent-based model that simulates epidemic and economic outcomes across industries, occupations and income levels. We validate the model by reproducing key outcomes of the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the New York metropolitan area. The key mechanism coupling the epidemic and economic modules is the reduction in consumption due to fear of infection. In counterfactual experiments, we show that a similar trade-off between epidemic and economic outcomes exists both when individuals change their behaviour due to fear of infection and when non-pharmaceutical interventions are imposed. Low-income workers, who perform in-person occupations in customer-facing industries, face the strongest trade-off.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue, and malaria, are re-emerging and expanding to new and formerly unaﬀected places, leading to a need for models which can track their evolution and thus help with public policy and epidemiological studies. Such diseases’ evolution is driven by the interactions between hosts and vectors, and is thus heavily dependent on factors like host and vector population distributions and mobility, and geographical and weather conditions. Traditionally used mathematical models fail to capture such issues, thereby creating a gap between what epidemiologists and disease modelers can provide, and what public health policy requires. We give a generalized agentbased model (ABM) which overcomes these limitations by careful integration of geographic information (GIS) and census data to account for the spatial movement of infections, and climate data to capture the temporal nature of an epidemc. It captures the disorganized interactions of hosts and vectors at a micro-scale by explicitly modeling each human and mosquito to simulate the complex trajectories of disease outbreaks (even those have yet to occur), and makes it possible to test the eﬃcacy of various public health policies. This model also suggests that it is possible to estimate hardto-determine parameters about vectors (e.g., a mosquito’s sensing distance), through simple model calibration. Unlike previous solutions, our model is trained and validated using real data from a 2013-14 chikungunya epidemic in the Caribbean and is seen to give accurate results.},

We review key areas in public health where agent-based modeling has been adopted, including both communicable and noncommunicable disease, health behaviors, and social epidemiology. We also describe the main strengths and limitations of this approach for questions with public health relevance. Finally, we describe both methodologic and substantive future directions that we believe will enhance the value of agent-based modeling for public health. In particular, advances in model validation, comparisons with other causal modeling procedures, and the expansion of the models to consider comorbidity and joint inﬂuences more systematically will improve the utility of this approach to inform public health research, practice, and policy.},

	abstract = {Background: Over half the world’s human populations are currently at risk from vector-borne diseases (VBDs), and the heaviest burden is borne by the world’s poorest people, communities, and countries. The aim of this study was to conduct a review on VBD interventions relevant to housing and hygiene (including sanitation and waste management) in urban areas. Main body: We conducted a scoping review, which involved systematically searching peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016 using five scientific databases and one database for grey literature. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction. We assessed the quality of each study using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and extracted descriptive characteristics and data about implementation process and transferability from all studies using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and ASTAIRE (a tool for analyzing the transferability of health promotion interventions) tools. We reviewed 44 studies. Overall, the studies were judged to be of high risk for bias. Our results suggest multifaceted interventions, particularly community-based interventions, have the potential to achieve wider and more sustained effects than do standard vertical single-component programs. The evaluations of multifaceted interventions tend to include integrated evaluations, using not only entomological indicators but also acceptability and sustainability indicators. Conclusions: This review highlighted the important need for higher quality research in VBDs and improved and standardized reporting of interventions. Significant research gaps were found regarding qualitative research and implementation research, and results highlighted the need for more interventions focus on sanitation and hygiene practices.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing worldwide burden of dengue fever, the global economic impact of dengue illness is poorly documented. Using a common protocol, we present the first multicountry estimates of the direct and indirect costs of dengue cases in eight American and Asian countries. We conducted prospective studies of the cost of dengue in five countries in the Americas (Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Venezuela) and three countries in Asia (Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand). All studies followed the same core protocol with interviews and medical record reviews. The study populations were patients treated in ambulatory and hospital settings with a clinical diagnosis of dengue. Most studies were performed in 2005. Costs are in 2005 international dollars (I\$). We studied 1,695 patients (48\% pediatric and 52\% adult); none died. The average illness lasted 11.9 days for ambulatory patients and 11.0 days for hospitalized patients. Among hospitalized patients, students lost 5.6 days of school, whereas those working lost 9.9 work days per average dengue episode. Overall mean costs were I\$514 and I\$1,394 for an ambulatory and hospitalized case, respectively. With an annual average of 574,000 cases reported, the aggregate annual economic cost of dengue for the eight study countries is at least I\$587 million. Preliminary adjustment for under-reporting could raise this total to \$1.8 billion, and incorporating costs of dengue surveillance and vector control would raise the amount further. Dengue imposes substantial costs on both the health sector and the overall economy.},

	abstract = {Modern societies are exposed to a myriad of risks ranging from disease to natural hazards and technological disruptions. Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agentbased modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socioenvironmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.},

	abstract = {A multi-agent simulation (MAS) was developed to assess the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue in southern France, a non-endemic area where mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (Culicidae) live. The contact rate between people and potential malaria vectors, or the human biting rate, is one of the key factor to predict the risk of re-emergence of malaria, would the parasite be introduced in the region. Our model (called MALCAM) represents the different agents that could inﬂuence malaria transmission in the Camargue –people, mosquitoes, animal hosts and the landscape – in a spatially explicit environment. The model simulates spatial and temporal variations in human biting rate at the landscape scale. These variations depend on the distribution of people and potential vectors, their behaviour and their interactions. A land use/cover map was used as a cellular-spatial support for the movements of and interactions between mobile agents. The model was tested for its sensitivity to variations in parameter values, and for the agreement between ﬁeld observations and model predictions. The MALCAM model provides a tool to better understand the interactions between the multiple agents of the disease transmission system, and the land use and land cover factors that control the spatial heterogeneity in these interactions. It allows testing hypotheses and scenarios related to disease dynamics by varying the value of exogenous biological, geographical, or human factors. This application of agentbased modelling to a human vector-borne disease can be adapted to different diseases and regions.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To explore public perceptions and behaviours related to the risk of flavivirus and alphavirus infection in Southeastern regions of France following the recent colonisation of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, and the identification of four autochthonous cases of dengue and chikungunya fever in these regions. Design: Cross-sectional telephone survey using a proportional random digit dialling selection method. Setting: Interviews were conducted from 28 November 2011 to 29 January 2012 using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. Participants: 1506 French speaking adults aged 18 years or older residing in French Mediterranean regions.
Results: Protective health behaviours were found to be performed less frequently among men (AOR=0.65, 95\% CI 0.52\% to 0.80\%), residents with lower educational status (AOR=0.61, 95\% CI 0.43\% to 0.85\% for respondents with primary school education; AOR=0.69, 95\% CI 0.53\% to 0.90\% for those with some secondary school education), and those living in regions where the Aedes mosquito is objectively rare (AOR=0.60, 95\% CI 0.36\% to 0.98\% for Aude; AOR=0.63, 95\% CI 0.44\% to 0.89\% for Herault; AOR=0.56, 95\% CI 0.34\% to 0.93\% for Eastern Pyrenees). Empirical results also suggest that behavioural responses to infection risk are greater shaped by the perceived exposure to Aedes, notably the perceived frequency of mosquito bites (AOR=2.07, 95\% CI 1.84\% to 2.32\%) and visual identification of Aedes mosquitoes in one’s immediate environment (AOR=1.98, 95\% CI 1.45\% to 2.71\%) rather than by other common predictors of protective behaviours.
Conclusions: These findings may help with the development of innovative instruments designed to make more visible and personal the threat of flavivirus and alphavirus infections induced by the presence of A albopictus in order to promote significant behavioural changes among populations at risk.},

	abstract = {The relationships between risk perception and related behavior form a fundamental theme in risk analysis. Despite increasing attentions on the temporal dimension of risk perception and behavior in recent literature, the dynamic relationships between these two constructs remain understudied. Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, provide a key setting for analyzing evolving perceptions of and responses to natural or human-induced hazards. The main objectives of this research are: (1) to assess temporal changes in cognitive and affective dimensions of perceived COVID-19 risk as well as related protective behavior; and (2) to explore the dynamic relationships between COVID-19 risk perception and behavioral re­ sponses. Timely data on changing risk perception and behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak were collected through two series of online surveys from four major cities (Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City; N = 736) and the central Midwest region of the United States (N = 1240) respectively during March–August 2020. The analysis revealed that: (1) the cognitive and affective dimensions of perceived COVID-19 risk and preventive behavior all changed over time; (2) there were both within- and across-time correlations between COVID-19 risk perception indicators and preventive actions; and (3) preventive actions showed varied feedback effects on in­ dividual aspects of perceived COVID-19 risk over time. Findings from this research support and expand major conceptual approaches to changing relationships between risk perception and behavior, particularly the risk reappraisal hypothesis. The study also has useful implications for health risk management and future research directions.},

	abstract = {Background:  Millions of people worldwide are exposed to deadly infectious diseases on a regular basis. Breaking news of the Zika outbreak for instance, made it to the main media titles internationally. Perceiving disease risks moti‑vate people to adapt their behavior toward a safer and more protective lifestyle. Computational science is instrumen‑tal in exploring patterns of disease spread emerging from many individual decisions and interactions among agents and their environment by means of agent-based models. Yet, current disease models rarely consider simulating dynamics in risk perception and its impact on the adaptive protective behavior. Social sciences offer insights into indi‑vidual risk perception and corresponding protective actions, while machine learning provides algorithms and meth‑ods to capture these learning processes. This article presents an innovative approach to extend agent-based disease models by capturing behavioral aspects of decision-making in a risky context using machine learning techniques. We illustrate it with a case of cholera in Kumasi, Ghana, accounting for spatial and social risk factors that affect intelligent behavior and corresponding disease incidents. The results of computational experiments comparing intelligent with zero-intelligent representations of agents in a spatial disease agent-based model are discussed.
Methods:  We present a spatial disease agent-based model (ABM) with agents’ behavior grounded in Protection Motivation Theory. Spatial and temporal patterns of disease diffusion among zero-intelligent agents are compared to those produced by a population of intelligent agents. Two Bayesian Networks (BNs) designed and coded using R and are further integrated with the NetLogo-based Cholera ABM. The first is a one-tier BN1 (only risk perception), the second is a two-tier BN2 (risk and coping behavior).
Results:  We run three experiments (zero-intelligent agents, BN1 intelligence and BN2 intelligence) and report the results per experiment in terms of several macro metrics of interest: an epidemic curve, a risk perception curve, and a distribution of different types of coping strategies over time.
Conclusions:  Our results emphasize the importance of integrating behavioral aspects of decision making under risk into spatial disease ABMs using machine learning algorithms. This is especially relevant when studying cumulative impacts of behavioral changes and possible intervention strategies.},

We developed a pair model with a susceptible–infected–susceptible structure representing heterosexuals aged 16–26 years. The effect of testing on chlamydia prevalence was compared between a model with only SB (SB model) and a model with SB and RP (SB–RP model). In the SB–RP model, a scenario without differential testing uptake in SB–RP groups was compared to scenarios with differential testing uptake in SB–RP groups. Introducing testing into the SB–RP model resulted in a slightly smaller reduction in chlamydia prevalence (−38.0\%) as compared to the SB model (−40.4\%). In the SB–RP model, the scenario without differential testing uptake in SB–RP groups overestimated the reduction in chlamydia prevalence (with 4.8\%), especially in the group with high SB and low RP (19.8\%). We conclude that mathematical models incorporating RP and differential testing uptake in SB–RP groups improve the impact assessment of testing and treatment on chlamydia prevalence.},

            There has been growing use of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV and significant progress in developing prophylactic HIV vaccines. The simplest theories of counterproductive behavioral responses to such interventions tend to focus on single feedback mechanisms: for instance, HAART optimism makes infection less scary and thus promotes risky sexual behavior. Here, we develop an agent based, age-structured model of HIV transmission, risk perception and partner selection in a core group to explore behavioral responses to interventions. We find that interventions can activate not one, but several feedback mechanisms that could potentially influence decision-making and HIV prevalence. In the model, HAART increases the attractiveness of unprotected sex, but it also increases perceived risk of infection and, on longer timescales, causes demographic impacts that partially counteract HAART optimism. Both HAART and vaccination usually lead to lower rates of unprotected sex on the whole, but intervention effectiveness depends strongly on whether individuals over- or under-estimate intervention coverage. Age-specific effects cause sexual behavior and HIV prevalence to change in opposite ways in old and young age groups. For complex infections like HIV—where interventions influence transmission, demography, sexual behavior and risk perception—we conclude that evaluations of behavioral responses should consider multiple feedback mechanisms.},

Next, parameters were found that most consistently led to a scenario when outbreak severity was clearly made worse by circulating poor quality disease prevention advice. Strategies to counter ‘‘fake’’ health news were tested.
Results. – Reducing bad advice to 30\% of total information or making at least 30\% of people fully resistant to believing in and sharing bad health advice were effective thresholds to counteract the negative impacts of bad advice during a norovirus outbreak.

HIV is transmitted during unprotected sex with a certain probability. As expected, in model simulations, the perceived populationlevel HIV prevalence climbs along with actual HIV prevalence. During this time, HIVÀ individuals increasingly switch from unprotected sex to protected sex, HIVþ individuals continue practicing unprotected sex whenever possible, and unprotected sex between HIVþ and HIVÀ individuals eventually becomes rare. We also ﬁnd that the perceived population-level HIV prevalence diverges according to HIV status: HIVÀ individuals develop a higher perceived HIV prevalence than HIVþ individuals, although this result is sensitive to how much information is derived from global versus local sources. This research illustrates a potential mechanism by which distinct groups, as deﬁned by their sexual behaviour, HIV status, and risk perceptions, can emerge through coevolution of HIV transmission and risk perception dynamics.},

	abstract = {In the outbreak of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, social media channels are important tools for the public to obtain information and form their opinions on infection risk, which can affect their disease prevention behaviors and the consequent disease transmission processes. However, there has been a lack of theoretical investigation into how social media and human behaviors jointly affect the spread of infectious diseases. In this study, we develop an agent-based modeling framework that couples (1) a general opinion dynamics model that describes how individuals form their opinions on epidemic risk with various information sources, (2) a behavioral adoption model that simulates the adoption of disease prevention behaviors, and (3) an epidemiological SEIR model that simulates the spread of diseases in a host population. Through simulating the spread of a coronavirus-like disease in a hypothetical residential area, the modeling results show that social media can make a community more sensitive to external drivers. Social media can increase the public's awareness of infection risk, which is beneﬁcial for epidemic containment, when high-quality epidemic information exists at the early stage of pandemics. However, fabricated and fake news on social media, after a “latent period”, can lead to a signiﬁcant increase in infection rate. The modeling results provide scientiﬁc evidence for the intricate interplay between social media and human behaviors in epidemic dynamics and control, and highlight the importance of public education to promote behavioral changes and the need to correct misinformation and fake news on social media in a timely manner.},

Findings suggest that risk perceptions vary over time and are interpreted on the basis of visible contamination, cognition and context. Risk perceptions influence the efficacy of risk reduction strategies. Although risk is viewed as a communal problem, notions of individual, community and institutional responsibilities structure the perceptions and attitudes to local hygiene and infectious disease reduction strategies. Perceived risk variously acts as a motivator in the adoption of risk management approaches. However, a lack of infectious disease interventions by other community members and local institutions devalues individual motivation to combat risk of cholera. Community involvement in addressing vulnerability to disease requires knowledge of multiple influences on risk perceptions and governance contexts that facilitate collective control and responsibility.},

	abstract = {Objective: In this study, we took advantage of a large epidemic of chikungunya, an emerging mosquito-borne disease, in French Guiana to examine the dynamic interaction between risk-related perceptions and behaviours that occurs in response to a disease outbreak. In particular, we tested empirically the assumption that both risk perceptions and health behaviours were elastic with respect to prevalence of chikungunya.
Methods: A representative sample of French Guianan (N=434) was interviewed in January 2015 just after the peak of the epidemic, and again 2 months later. Participants were asked about their perceptions of the threat, as well as their engagement in a range of protective behaviours promoted by the regional health authorities to control the spread of the disease.
Results: The surveys showed that (1) the frequency of some health behaviours - those related to visible control methods - significantly increased with the subjective and objective prevalence of the disease, (2) perceived risk of infection for oneself tended to decrease considerably over time, and (3) the risk reappraisal hypothesis failed to account for this paradoxical trend in the people's response to the risk of contracting the disease.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that people may fail to adjust their risk perceptions, and to a lesser extent their health protective behaviours, to the course of an epidemic. Notably, the prevalence elasticity of preventive action found in previous studies of behavioural response to infectious diseases differed substantially according to the type of intervention (personal versus environmental methods). This paradoxical trend may be attributed to risk habituation effects, which seem to vary significantly according to the social visibility of thepreventive actions.},

	abstract = {After a longstanding global presence, malaria is now largely non-existent or suppressed in most parts of the world. Today, cases and deaths are primarily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. According to many experts, this persistence on the African continent reflects factors such as resistance to insecticides and drugs as well as insufficient access to essential commodities such as insecticide-treated nets and effective drugs. Crucially, however, this narrative ignores many central weaknesses in the fight against malaria and instead reinforces a narrow, commodity-driven vision of disease control. This paper therefore describes the core challenges hindering malaria programs in Africa and highlights key opportunities to rethink current strategies for sustainable control and elimination. The epidemiology of malaria in Africa presents far greater challenges than elsewhere and requires context-specific initiatives tailored to national and sub-national targets. To sustain progress, African countries must systematically address key weaknesses in its health systems, improve the quality and use of data for surveillance-responses, improve both technical and leadership competencies for malaria control, and gradually reduce overreliance on commodities while expanding multisectoral initiatives such as improved housing and environmental sanitation. They must also leverage increased funding from both domestic and international sources, and support pivotal research and development efforts locally. Effective vaccines and drugs, or other potentially transformative technologies such as genedrive modified mosquitoes, could further accelerate malaria control by complementing current tools. However, our underlying strategies remain insufficient and must be expanded to include more holistic and context-specific approaches critical to achieve and sustain effective malaria control.},

Lack of a robust infrastructure for timely collection, reporting, and analysis of epidemic data undermines necessary preparedness and thus posing serious health challenges to the general public. By developing a simulation framework that models population dynamics and the interactions of both humans and mosquitoes, we may enable epidemiologists to analyze and forecast the transmission and spread of an infectious disease in speciﬁc areas. We extend the traditional SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) mathematical model and propose an Agent-based model to analyze the interactions between the host and the vector using: (i) our proposed algorithm to compute vector density, based on the reproductive behavior of the vector; and (ii) agent interactions to simulate transmission of virus in a spatio-temporal environment, and forecast the spread of the disease in a given area over a period of time. Our simulation results identify several expected dengue cases and their direction of spread, which can help in detecting epidemic outbreaks. Our proposed framework provides visualization and forecasting capabilities to study the epidemiology of a certain region and aid public health departments in emergency preparedness.},

	abstract = {A typical epidemic often involves the transmission of a disease, the ﬂow of information regarding the disease, and the spread of human preventive behaviors against the disease. These three processes diffuse simultaneously through human social networks, and interact with one another, forming negative and positive feedback loops in the complex human-disease systems. Few studies, however, have been devoted to coupling all the three diffusions together and representing their interactions. To ﬁll the knowledge gap, this article proposes a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate a triple-diffusion process in a metropolitan area of 1 million people. The individual-based approach, network model, behavioral theories, and stochastic processes are used to formulate the three diffusions and integrate them together. Compared to the observed facts, the model results reasonably replicate the trends of inﬂuenza spread and information propagation. The model thus could be a valid and effective tool to evaluate information/behavior-based intervention strategies. Besides its implications to the public health, the research ﬁndings also contribute to network modeling, systems science, and medical geography.},

	abstract = {The recent adoption of ubiquitous computing technologies has enabled capturing large amounts of human behavioral data. The digital footprints computed from these datasets provide information for the study of social and human dynamics, including social networks and mobility patterns, key elements for the effective modeling of virus spreading. Traditional epidemiologic models do not consider individual information and hence have limited ability to capture the inherent complexity of the disease spreading process. To overcome this limitation, agent-based models have recently been proposed as an effective approach to model virus spreading. However, most agent-based approaches to date have not included real-life data to characterize the agents’ behavior. In this paper we propose an agent-based system that uses social interactions and individual mobility patterns extracted from call detail records to accurately model virus spreading. The proposed approach is applied to study the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Mexico and to evaluate the impact that government mandates had on the spreading of the virus. Our simulations indicate that the restricted mobility due the government mandates reduced by 10\% the peak number of individuals infected by the virus and postponed the peak of the pandemic by two days.},

Unfortunately, the advantages of ABMs are realized at the cost of signiﬁcantly large execution times and high memory consumption for large-scale simulations. To address the memory issue, we designed and implemented an ABM using an innovative feature: the bitstring approach, in which the attributes of each agent are represented by an array of bits instead using traditional data structures. To cope with the high computational demands, we developed a parallel version of model aiming multicore CPUs and GPUs architectures using Thrust parallel algorithms library. The results of our model were validated comparing them with data of a spread of Inﬂuenza A in the Cascavel City, South Brazil, occurred in 2009. The model presented good qualitative results and an excellent performance on GPUs. The application of bitstring technique is proved to be relevant in economy of memory, allowing to store the same attributes using 41\% less memory space and improving the data copy time between CPU and GPU up to 52\%.},

	abstract = {Compared with many other diseases, the ever-increasing threat of vectorborne diseases (VBDs) represents a great challenge to public and animal health managers. Complex life cycles, changing distribution ranges, a variety of potential vectors and hosts, and the possible role of reservoirs make surveillance for VBDs a grave concern in a changing environment with increasing economic constraints. Surveillance activities may have various specific objectives and may focus on clinical disease, pathogens, vectors, hosts and/or reservoirs, but ultimately such activities should improve our ability to predict, prevent and/or control the diseases concerned. This paper briefly reviews existing and newly developed tools for the surveillance of VBDs. A range of examples, by no means exhaustive, illustrates that VBD surveillance usually involves a combination of methods to achieve its aims, and is best accomplished when these techniques are adapted to the specific environment and constraints of the region. More so than any other diseases, VBDs respect no administrative boundaries; in addition, animal, human and commodity movements are increasing dramatically, with illegal or unknown movements difficult to quantify. Vector-borne disease surveillance therefore becomes a serious issue for local and national organisations and is being conducted more and more at the regional and international level through multidisciplinary networks. With economic and logistical constraints, tools for optimising and evaluating the performance of surveillance systems are essential and examples of recent developments in this area are included. The continuous development of mapping, analytical and modelling tools provides us with an enhanced ability to interpret, visualise and communicate surveillance results. This review also demonstrates the importance of the link between surveillance and research, with interactions and benefits in both directions.},

An understanding of the reasons for this is needed to improve future vaccination strategies. The 2017 measles outbreak in Guinea provided an opportunity to qualitatively explore suboptimal vaccination coverage within an MVC among participants through their perceptions, experiences and challenges.
Methods: We conducted focus group discussions with caregivers (n=68) and key informant interviews (n=13) with health professionals and religious and community leaders in Conakry. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim from Susu and French, coded and thematically analysed.
Results: Vaccinations were widely regarded positively and their preventive beneﬁts noted. Vaccine side effects and the subsequent cost of treatment were commonly reported concerns, with further knowledge requested. Community health workers (CHWs) play a pivotal role in MVCs. Caregivers suggested recruiting CHWs from local neighbourhoods and improving their attitude, knowledge and skills to provide information about vaccinations. Lack of trust in vaccines, CHWs and the healthcare system, particularly after the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic, were also reported.
Conclusions: Improving caregivers’ knowledge of vaccines, potential side effects and their management are essential to increase MVC coverage in urban settings. Strengthening CHWs’ capacities and appropriate recruitment are key to improving trust through a community involvement approach.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne emerging and re-emerging diseases pose considerable public health problem worldwide. Some of these diseases are emerging and/or re-emerging at increasing rates and appeared in new regions in the past two decades. Studies emphasized that the interactions among pathogens, hosts, and the environment play a key role for the emergence or re-emergence of these diseases. Furthermore, social and demographic factors such as human population growth, urbanization, globalization, trade exchange and travel and close interactions with livestock have signiﬁcantly been linked with the emergence and/or re-emergence of vector-borne diseases. Other studies emphasize the ongoing evolution of pathogens, proliferation of reservoir populations, and antimicrobial drug use to be the principal exacerbating forces for emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne infectious diseases. Still other studies equivocally claim that climate change has been associated with appearance and resurgence of vector-borne infectious diseases. Despite the fact that many important emerging and re-emerging vector-borne infectious diseases are becoming better controlled, our success in stopping the many new appearing and resurging vector-borne infectious diseases that may happen in the future seems to be uncertain. Hence, this paper reviews and synthesizes the existing literature to explore global patterns of emerging and re-emerging vector-borne infections and the challenges for their control. It also attempts to give insights to the epidemiological proﬁle of major vector-borne diseases including Zika fever, dengue, West Nile fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Chikungunya, Yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever.},

Conversely, there is limited evidence on how well those CBIs succeed in producing speciﬁc outcomes in different contexts. To conduct a realist synthesis for knowledge translation on this topic, we examined the extent to which realist concepts (context, mechanisms, and outcomes) and their relationships are present in the existing literature on CBIs for VBDs. Articles on CBIs were identiﬁed from prior scoping reviews of health interventions for VBDs. Content of the articles was extracted verbatim if it referred either to realist concepts or CBI features. The number of articles and the average number of words extracted per category per CBI were quantiﬁed. Content of the articles was scrutinized to inductively gather qualitative evidence on the interactions between realist concepts. We reviewed 41 articles on 17 CBIs from 12 countries. The average number of words used for mechanisms was much lower than those used for outcomes and context (309,474, and 836, respectively). The average number of words used for mechanisms increased when a CBI was described in three or more articles. There were more extensive accounts on CBI features than on mechanisms. It was difﬁcult to gather evidence on the interactions among realist concepts from the content of the articles. Scarce reporting on mechanisms in published articles limits conducting a realist synthesis of CBIs in VBDs. More transdisciplinary research that goes beyond the biomedical paradigm is needed to boost the development of intervention mechanisms in this ﬁeld.},

A large part of the risk management task involves anticipating, explaining and reacting to this response. One of the main approaches we have for analysing the emergent public response, the social ampliﬁcation of risk framework, has been the subject of little modelling. The purpose of this paper is to explore how social risk ampliﬁcation can be represented and simulated. The importance of heterogeneity among risk perceivers, and the role of their social networks in shaping risk perceptions, makes it natural to take an agent-based approach. We look in particular at how to model some central aspects of many risk events: the way actors come to observe other actors more than external events in forming their risk perceptions; the way in which behaviour both follows risk perception and shapes it; and the way risk communications are fashioned in the light of responses to previous communications. We show how such aspects can be represented by availability cascades, but also how this creates further problems of how to represent the contrasting effects of informational and reputational elements, and the differentiation of private and public risk beliefs. Simulation of the resulting model shows how certain qualitative aspects of risk response time series found empirically – such as endogenously-produced peaks in risk concern – can be explained by this model.},

The model is initialised to a deterministic stationary state and a subset of its free parameters are calibrated empirically in order to reproduce characteristics of UK macro-time-series data. Experiments carried out on the baseline focus on the expectations formation and forecasting behaviour of banks through allowing banks to switch between forecasting strategies and having them engage in least-squares learning. Overall, simple heuristics are remarkably robust in the model. In the baseline, which represents a relatively stable environment, the use of arguably more sophisticated expectations formation mechanisms makes little difference to simulation results. In a modified version of the baseline representing a less stable environment alternative heuristics may in fact be destabilising. To conclude the paper, a range of policy experiments is conducted, showing that an appropriate mix of monetary and prudential policy can considerably attenuate the macroeconomic volatility produced by the model.},

	abstract = {Healthcare, like other industries, large corporations, and institutions, is a complex system composed of many diverse interacting components. Frequently, to improve performance of a system, to move into new markets, or to expand capability or capacity, healthcare decision makers face opportunities or mandates to implement innovations (new technology, processes, and services). Successful implementation of these innovations involves seamless integration with the policy, economic, social, and technological dynamics associated with the complex system. These dynamics are frequently difficult for decision makers to observe and understand. Consequently, they take on risk from lack of insight into how best to implement the innovation and how their system-of-interest will ultimately perform. This research defines a modeling and simulation framework that provides decision makers with prospective insight into the likely performance to expect once an innovation is implemented in a complex system. We describe the need for such a framework when modeling complex systems, and we discuss suitable simulation paradigms and the challenges related to implementing these simulations. We focus on a specific example in the healthcare field to demonstrate the framework’s application and utility in understanding how an innovation, once fielded, will actually affect the larger complex system to which it belongs.},

	abstract = {Urban road trafﬁc dynamics are the product of the behaviours and interactions of thousands, often millions of individuals. Traditionally, models of these phenomena have incorporated simplistic representations of individual behaviour, ensuring the maximisation of simulation scale under given computational constraints. Yet, by simplifying representations of behaviour, the overall predictive capability of the model inevitably reduces. In this work a hybrid agent-based modelling framework is introduced that aims to balance the demands of behavioural realism and computational capacity, integrating a descriptive representation of driver behaviour with a simpliﬁed, collective model of trafﬁc ﬂow. The hybridisation of these approaches within an agent-based modelling framework yields a representation of urban trafﬁc ﬂow that is driven by individual behaviour, yet, in reducing the computational intensity of simulated physical interaction, enables the scalable expansion to large numbers of agents. A real-world proofof-concept case study is presented, demonstrating the application of this approach, and showing the gains in computational efﬁciency made in utilising this approach against traditional agent-based approaches. The paper concludes in addressing how this model might be extended, and exploring the role hybrid agent-based modelling approaches may hold in the simulation of other complex urban phenomena.},

	abstract = {Shallow lake ecosystems are widely impaired by eutrophication. Lake restoration projects frequently fail or are only partially successful, reflecting that environmental managers face difficult challenges in addressing this complex problem. Key uncertainties relate to selecting appropriate methods and predicting the resulting response trajectory, that is, “what should be done, how much improvement should be expected, and how long will it take?” This review critically evaluates approaches applied to address eutrophication in shallow lakes. A set of shallow lake restoration case studies from across the globe, involving moderate to high effort monitoring, was evaluated to determine common features and to identify advantages/disadvantages and drivers of successful restoration projects. Approaches are broadly grouped into four categories: 1) external nutrient load reductions, 2) internal nutrient load reductions, 3) biomanipulation, and 4) hydrological manipulations. Case studies highlight that external load reduction is an essential component of successful restoration, although supplementary measures can support restoration goals. To inform planning and help set realistic expectations, the following key challenges to the restoration of shallow lakes were identified: 1) insufficient reductions in external nutrient loads, 2) biogeochemical lags, 3) resistance of a stable, algal-dominated state due to hysteresis in the turbidity–nutrient load relationship, 4) delayed macrophyte reestablishment, 5) climate change, 6) need for lake-specific approaches, and 7) social and political shortcomings. Managing these challenges is crucial to the success of shallow lake restoration projects.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Depression is a common mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Care pathways for depression are complex and the demand across different parts of the healthcare system is often uncertain and not entirely understood. Clinical progression with depression can be equally complex and relates to whether or not a patient is seeking care, the care pathway they are on, and the ability for timely access to healthcare services. Considering both pathways and progression for depression are however rarely studied together in the literature.
            
            
              Methods
              This paper presents a hybrid simulation modeling framework that is uniquely able to capture both disease progression, using Agent Based Modeling, and related care pathways, using a System Dynamics. The two simulation paradigms within the framework are connected to run synchronously to investigate the impact of depression progression on healthcare services and, conversely, how any limitations in access to services may impact clinical progression. The use of the developed framework is illustrated by parametrising it with published clinical data and local service level data from Wales, UK.
            
            
              Results and discussion
              The framework is able to quantify demand, service capacities and costs across all care pathways for a range of different scenarios. These include those for varying service coverage and provision, such as the cost-effectiveness of treating patients more quickly in community settings to reduce patient progression to more severe states of depression, and thus reducing the costs and utilization of more expensive specialist settings.},

However, inadequate representation of the detailed population structure can lead to spurious results, especially when the epidemic process is beginning and individual variation is critical. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach that combines the two modeling paradigms and introduces a hybrid model that starts as agent-based and switches to equation-based after the number of infected individuals is large enough to support a population-averaged approach.

We hypothesize that these factors along with interactions of factors and the actions of individuals would lead to outbreaks of different size and severity even in two towns that appear similar on paper. Thus, it is necessary to implement a model that is able to capture these interactions and the actions of individuals. Using openly available data we create a data-driven agent-based model to simulate the spread of an airborne infectious disease in an Irish town. Agent-based models have been known to produce results that include the emergence of patterns and behaviours that are not directly programmed into the model. Our model is tested by simulating an outbreak of measles that occurred in Schull, Ireland in 2012. We simulate the same outbreak in 33 different towns and look at the correlations between the model results and the town characteristics (population, area, vaccination rates, age structure) to determine if the results of the model are affected by interactions of those town characteristics and the decisions on the agents in the model. As expected our results show that the outbreaks are not strongly correlated with any of the main characteristics of the towns and thus the model is most likely capturing such interactions and the agent-based model is successful in capturing the differences in the outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Biologically related processes operate across multiple spatiotemporal scales. For computational modeling methodologies to mimic this biological complexity, individual scale models must be linked in ways that allow for dynamic exchange of information across scales. A powerful methodology is to combine a discrete modeling approach, agent-based models (ABMs), with continuum models to form hybrid models. Hybrid multi-scale ABMs have been used to simulate emergent responses of biological systems. Here, we review two aspects of hybrid multi-scale ABMs: linking individual scale models and efﬁciently solving the resulting model. We discuss the computational choices associated with aspects of linking individual scale models while simultaneously maintaining model tractability. We demonstrate implementations of existing numerical methods in the context of hybrid multi-scale ABMs. Using an example model describing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we show relative computational speeds of various combinations of numerical methods. Efﬁcient linking and solution of hybrid multi-scale ABMs is key to model portability, modularity, and their use in understanding biological phenomena at a systems level.},

This study examines the diffusion patterns of these two approaches and the main driving factors. We conducted a systematic analysis of 653 journal articles published from 1972 to 2014 that employed two approaches in health research and found that over the last few years, there has been a rapid increase of studies in using ABM compared with SDM, partly due to the launching of new journals and the application of ABM to a broad range of topics. The concentration of SDM studies in just a few journals may be adversely affecting its diffusion. The last decade saw acceleration in using ABM to investigate infectious diseases and cancer while SDM applications have predominantly focused on non‐communicable diseases such as obesity.

Equation-based models have been shown to capture the overall dynamics of a disease outbreak while agent-based models are able to capture heterogeneous characteristics of agents that drive the spread of an outbreak. However, agent-based models are computationally intensive. To capture the advantages of both the equation-based and agent-based models, we create a hybrid model where the disease component of the hybrid model switches between agent-based and equation-based. The switch is determined using the number of agents infected. We first test the model at the town level and then the county level investigating di erent switch values and geographic levels of switching. We find that a hybrid model is able to save time compared to a fully agent-based model without losing a significant amount of fidelity.},

We focus on systems that contain large numbers of active objects (people, business units, animals, vehicles, or even things like projects, stocks, products, etc. that have timing, event ordering or other kind of individual behavior associated with them). We compare the three major paradigms in simulation modeling: System Dynamics, Discrete Event and Agent Based Modeling with respect to how they approach such systems. We show in detail how an Agent Based model can be built from an existing System Dynamics or a Discrete Event model and then show how easily it can be further enhanced to capture much more complicated behavior, dependencies and interactions thus providing for deeper insight in the system being modeled. Commonly understood examples are used throughout the paper; all models are specified in the visual language supported by AnyLogicTM tool. We view and present Agent Based modeling not as a substitution to older modeling paradigms but as a useful add-on that can be efficiently combined with System Dynamics and Discrete Event modeling. Several multi-paradigm model architectures are suggested.},

The situation in the social sciences is not very different: Reproducibility in psychological research, for example, has been estimated to be below 50\% as well (Open Science Collaboration in Science 349:6251, 2015). Less well studied is the issue of reproducibility of simulation research. A few replication studies of agent-based models, however, suggest the problem for computational modeling may be more severe than for laboratory experiments (Willensky and Rand in JASSS 10(4):2, 2007; Donkin et al. in Environ Model Softw 92:142–151, 2017; Bajracharya and Duboz in: Proceedings of the symposium on theory of modeling and simulation—DEVS integrative M\&S symposium, pp 6–11, 2013).

	abstract = {Predicting which species will present (or absent) across geographical regions, and where, remains one of the important issues in ecology. From a methodical viewpoint, one of the concerns in examining species presence–absence across an environmental gradient is about the robustness of model-based predictions, which are given by distinct modelling frameworks used. Generally, different complexities and ecological factors are incorporated into such models, e.g. abiotic environments, spatial dispersal process, and stochasticity. Motivated by these ecological issues, we revisit a single-species logistic growth problem by employing stochastic agent-based model (ABM) and deterministic system and extend these frameworks to incorporate the effects of spatially changing environments. We observe that our ABM, which is formulated using random walk theory and birth–death process, demonstrates important qualitative behaviours that are consistent with the underlying theories of stochastic process. The results of ABM with large population sizes also agree with those of the deterministic equation. However, some discrepancies are observed when the population size is small. The ABM densities seem to underestimate the deterministic solutions, which illustrate the effects of stochasticity on small populations with some individuals may go extinct simply by chance. To quantify the underestimation of ABM as opposed to deterministic predictions, we employ certain probabilistic techniques: while the means of quasistationary probabilities distribution appear to give a counterintuitive prediction particularly near the edge of species ranges, the expected values given by state probabilities distribution are in agreement with the ABM densities observed for small population sizes across spatial locations. These salient observations depict emergent behaviours of stochastic ABM, which can contribute to additional insights on the dynamics of ecological species. It also shows how such small-scale interactions coupled with local dispersal and spatial phenomena occurring at a microscopic level can affect macroscopic-level dynamics. As such, comparing and contrasting the dynamics of different models can help in understanding the generality of ecological results and may offer important insights into the robustness of model-based predictions of species presence–absence.},

Forrester’s System Dynamics (SD) is another longstanding technique for modeling social systems. Several classical models of systems, such as the Kermack-McKendrick model of epidemiology, the Lotka-Volterra equations for modeling predator-prey relationships, and the Bass model for innovation diffusion are formulated as systems of differential equations and have corresponding System Dynamics representations as difference equations. The ABS and SD modeling approaches take fundamentally different perspectives when modeling a system, which can be characterized as bottom-up (ABS) versus top-down (SD). Yet many systems can be equivalently modeled by either approach. In this paper, we present a formal specification for SD and ABS models, use the specification to derive equivalent ABS representations, and present an example of an SIR epidemic model having SD and ABS counterparts.},

Simulations were run without any speciﬁc interaction structure and varying the simulation parameters, we observed different attractors such as predominance of centrism or of extremism. We even observed in certain conditions, that the whole population drifts to one extreme of the opinion, even if initially there are an equal number of extremists at each extreme of the opinion axis. In the present paper, we study the inﬂuence of the social networks on the presence of such a dynamical behavior. In particular, we use small-world networks with variable connectivity and randomness of the connections. We ﬁnd that the drift to a single extreme appears only beyond a critical level of connectivity, which decreases when the randomness increases.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

Standards touch almost every part of our lives, from the water we drink to the language used to write this article. A sign of a good standard is one that we do not notice. Good standards exist and so do processes and organizations to create and maintain them. As agent-based modeling and simulation matures as a methodology, a discussion of standards applicable to it becomes increasingly important. Descriptive standards for agent-based models, such as the Overview, Design concepts, and Details protocol and agent-based extensions to the Unified Modeling Language, have already begun to emerge. Software tools for implementing such models, such as Netlogo and Repast Simphony, are increasingly well-known and have the potential to become de facto standards among the wider scientific community for agent-based simulation. Based on the findings of a series of workshops that brought together experts throughout the modeling and simulation community, we argue that agent-based modeling and simulation is no different from the other emerging technical subjects in the sense that standards, both existing and new, may be applicable to it, and that the community should both adopt existing standards that are relevant and exploit the already existing standards processes and organizations to develop new ones.},

Empirically, left–right self-placements are often not normally distributed but have multiple peaks (e.g., extreme-left-center-right-extreme). Some stylized facts are extracted from histograms from the European Social Survey. In the bounded conﬁdence model, agents repeatedly adjust their ideological position in their ideological neighborhood. As an extension of the classical model, agents sometimes completely reassess their opinion depending on their ideological openness and their propensity for reassessment, respectively. Simulations show that this leads to the emergence of clustered ideological landscapes similar to the ones observed empirically. However, not all stylized facts of real world ideological landscapes can be reproduced with the model.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a topology reconfiguration approach for improving the rate of convergence of opinions to the opinion of a pre-specified leader for the class of convergent Deffuant models with a limited number of links. From a systems theory perspective, this problem can be viewed as a constrained stochastic nonlinear on–off control problem. Accordingly, we first propose a deterministic version of the Deffuant model and rewrite its dynamic equations to reach a set of nonlinear state-space equations where opinions are state variables and link connectivities are inputs. For that model, we then design an on–off controller based on a short-sighted predictive control strategy that dynamically changes the topology of the network by a low computational burden process. Results confirm that the proposed control strategy reaches faster convergence rates of opinions to the leader’s opinion in comparison with the well-known Erdős–Rényi structure with a similar number of links. The proposed control strategy also provides a higher rate of link connectivity for the links that are connected to the leader. Furthermore, it is observed that if the network has a fixed topology based on the obtained rate of link connectivity, it will still have a relatively rapid convergence rate which is comparable with that of a fully connected topology.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the evolution of opinions over social networks with bounded conﬁdence in social cliques. Node initial opinions are independently and identically distributed; at each time step, nodes review the average opinions of a randomly selected local clique. The clique averages may represent local group pressures on peers. Then nodes update their opinions under bounded conﬁdence: only when the diﬀerence between an agent individual opinion and the corresponding local clique pressure is below a threshold, this agent opinion is updated according to the DeGroot rule as a weighted average of the two values. As a result, this opinion dynamics is a generalization of the classical Deﬀuant-Weisbuch model in which only pairwise interactions take place. First of all, we prove conditions under which all node opinions converge to ﬁnite limits. We show that in the limits the event that all nodes achieve a consensus, and the event that all nodes achieve pairwise distinct limits, i.e., social disagreements, are both nontrivial events. Next, we show that opinion ﬂuctuations may take place in the sense that at least one agent in the network fails to hold a converging opinion trajectory. In fact, we prove that this ﬂuctuation event happens with a strictly positive probability, and also constructively present an initial value event under which the ﬂuctuation event arises with probability one. These results add to the understanding of the role of bounded conﬁdence in social opinion dynamics, and the possibility of ﬂuctuation reveals that bringing in cliques in Deﬀuant-Weisbuch models have fundamentally changed the behavior of such opinion dynamical processes.},

We studied an agent-based model of networked agents collectively searching for solutions to simple and complex problems on an NK landscape. We implemented superiority bias as a reluctance to adopt solutions used by others unless they were substantially better than one’s own solution. We implemented communication errors by injecting noise into solutions learned from others. These factors both reduce the short-term efficiency of social learning, as individuals are less likely to faithfully copy superior solutions. We find that when a team faces complex problems, both communication noise and superiority bias have a positive effect on the overall quality of the team’s collective solution, at the cost of increased time and resource usage. We find that when a team faces simple problems, a moderate level of communication noise leads to a decrease in the required time and resources for a team. We discuss these results in terms of tradeoffs between the quality of a collective solution and the time and resources needed to reach that solution.},

However, these models are unable to simulate mixed, coexisting patterns of segregation and integration, which have been seen to exist in cities. Using evolutionary model discovery we demonstrate how including social factors beyond racial bias when modeling relocation behavior enables the emergence of strongly mixed patterns. Our results indicate that the emergence of mixed patterns is better explained by multiple factors influencing the decision to relocate; the most important being the interaction of nonlinear, rapidly diminishing racial bias with a recent, historical tendency to move. Additionally, preference for less isolated neighborhoods or preference for neighborhoods with longer residing neighbors may produce weaker mixed patterns. This work highlights the importance of exploring the influence of multiple hypothesized factors of decision making, and their interactions, within agent rules, when studying emergent outcomes generated by agent-based models of complex social systems.},

	abstract = {Social psychological theory posits entities and mechanisms that attempt to explain observable differences in behavior. For example, dual process theory suggests that an agent’s behavior is influenced by intentional (arising from reasoning involving attitudes and perceived norms) and unintentional (i.e., habitual) processes. In order to pass the generative sufficiency test as an explanation of alcohol use, we argue that the theory should be able to explain notable patterns in alcohol use that exist in the population, e.g., the distinct differences in drinking prevalence and average quantities consumed by males and females. In this study, we further develop and apply inverse generative social science (iGSS) methods to an existing agent-based model of dual process theory of alcohol use. Using iGSS, implemented within a multi-objective grammar-based genetic program, we search through the space of model structures to identify whether a single parsimonious model can best explain both male and female drinking, or whether separate and more complex models are needed. Focusing on alcohol use trends in New York State, we identify an interpretable model structure that achieves high goodness-of-fit for both male and female drinking patterns simultaneously, and which also validates successfully against reserved trend data. This structure offers a novel interpretation of the role of norms in formulating drinking intentions, but the structure’s theoretical validity is questioned by its suggestion that individuals with low autonomy would act against perceived descriptive norms. Improved evidence on the distribution of autonomy in the population is needed to understand whether this finding is substantive or is a modeling artefact.},

	abstract = {In black-box optimization, it is essential to understand why an algorithm instance works on a set of problem instances while failing on others and provide explanations of its behavior. We propose a methodology for formulating an algorithm instance footprint that consists of a set of problem instances that are easy to be solved and a set of problem instances that are difficult to be solved, for an algorithm instance. This behavior of the algorithm instance is further linked to the landscape properties of the problem instances to provide explanations of which properties make some problem instances easy or challenging. The proposed methodology uses meta-representations that embed the landscape properties of the problem instances and the performance of the algorithm into the same vector space. These meta-representations are obtained by training a supervised machine learning regression model for algorithm performance prediction and applying model explainability techniques to assess the importance of the landscape features to the performance predictions. Next, deterministic clustering of the meta-representations demonstrates that using them captures algorithm performance across the space and detects regions of poor and good algorithm performance, together with an explanation of which landscape properties are leading to it.},

	abstract = {Market diffusion of new products is driven by the actions and reactions of consumers, distributors, competitors, and other stakeholders, all of whom can be heterogeneous in their individual characteristics, attitudes, needs, and objectives. These actors may also interact with others in various ways (e.g., through word of mouth or social influence). Thus, a typical consumer market constitutes a complex system whose behavior is difficult to foresee because stochastic impulses may give rise to complex emergent patterns of system reactions over time. Agent-based modeling, a relatively novel approach to understanding complex systems, is well equipped to deal with this complexity and, therefore, may serve as a valuable tool for both researchers studying particular market effects and practitioners seeking decision support for determining features of products under development or the appropriate combination of measures to accelerate product diffusion in a market. This paper provides an overview of the strengths and criticisms of such tools. It aims to encourage researchers in the field of innovation management, as well as practitioners, to consider agent-based modeling and simulation as a method for gaining deeper insights into market behavior and making better-informed decisions.},
