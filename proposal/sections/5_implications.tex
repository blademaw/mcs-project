\section{Expected contributions and implications}

This proposed research aims to contribute both a methodological contribution to the modelling community, and an investigation into a neglected area of research in the field of VBDs. The first phase of the project will contribute an extension of an existing ABM to develop a generic framework for modelling VBDs with preventive measures. Additionally, the project will be one of the first research efforts to encode the \mbox{COM-B} model in an ABM and examine the consequences of alternative psychological behavioural theories as part of agents' decision-making processes on VBD spread. The second phase of the project will illuminate characteristics of CBIs that effectively promote preventive behaviours within the ABM, and in turn, curb VBD spread.
